# GPoser
A Garry's Mod addon to control your character's body and hands using your webcam. A spiritual successor to [FlexPoser](https://www.flexposer.com/) which also permits control of the hands and body. (facial expression control isn't actually implemented yet, but it will be). It's also a replacement for the Kinect integration built into GMod -  **All you need is a webcam!**

GPoser uses [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) to bring cutting edge AI into Garry's Mod.

# Installation

1. Switch your Garry's Mod to the x86-64 branch as described [here](https://swamp.sv/video/plugin-guide.html). Currently, only Windows is supported and you must run the game in 64 bit mode!

2. Download the two .dll files above (click on them, then click download).

3. Navigate to C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/GarrysMod (or whereever the game is installed) and place **opencv_world3410.dll** in this folder. There should be an "hl2.exe" in this folder already.

4. From that folder, navigate to garrysmod/lua, then create a folder called "bin" and place **gmcl_gposer_win64.dll** in that folder.

5. Join the server (it only works on [Swamp Cinema](https://swamp.sv/) currently) and in the shop, select the âœŒGPoser tab to control it. Your webcam will start controlling your player once it loads. Look in the bathroom mirror or use thirdperson (F4). Other players will see you!

***

The addon is currently in a very alpha state, and is only released as a binary for now, which only works on [Swamp Cinema](https://swamp.sv/). I plan to release this with source code in the future (I can't right now because it's built out of the mediapipe repository, so I have to figure out how to split them, and the code needs to be cleaned up a lot).
